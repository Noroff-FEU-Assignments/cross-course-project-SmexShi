    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <h3>Web Security Answer</h3>
    <p id="web-security-answer">First and foremost I would recommend to incurred users use stranger passwords with symbols and numbers, also it would be an excellent idea to let users use 2-factor authentication like Authenticator or Protect.
        </p>
    <p id="web-security-answer"> One more thing you can do is to use vulnerability scanning tools to see what to worry about, and in case of the worst thing, always have a backup of your website and SQL labially. To help you prevent cross-site scripting your site must allow only allowlisted data and encode all variable data output.
